Exercise 5:  Write a program that determines if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.
let age = 30;
if(age >=18){
    console.log('you are eligible for vote.')
}else{
    console.log('you are not eligible for vote.')
};

 Exercise 4:   Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.


let num = 10;
if (num % 2==0){
  console.log("Given num is even")
} else{
  console.log("Given num odd")
};


//Exercise 6:  Write a program that calculates the result of a mathematical expression.	((10 + 5) * 3 - 2) / (4 % 3)  - 7)

let 

 result = ((10 + 5) * 3 - 2) / (4 % 3)  - 7
// The mathimatical expression will be:
     console.log( "The Mathimatical Expression :"  ,  result);


//Exercise 3:  Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

let  
   num2 = 2;
    
   if (num2>0){
    console.log("The num2 is postive");
   } else if (num2<0){
   console.log("The num2 is negative");
   }else{
    console.log("The  num2 is zero")};

///Exercise 1:  Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle.
let
      width = 9;
      length = 15;
                  reasult = "area of rectangle =" ;length * width  ;
                                         console.log(reasult) ;      

///Exercise 2: Write a program that takes input and calculates the volume of a cube.

// By taking the a cube for finding  its volume
     let        
      l = 6;
      h = 5;
      w = 4;
      resault=VolumeOfCube = l*h*w;
      console.log(resault);
